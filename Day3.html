    QUES1-Write the Code for all Data types.?
    ANS-
    // Numbers: can be integers or decimals
    let number = 10; // integer
    let decimalNumber = 3.14; // decimal

    // Strings: sequences of characters
    let text = "Hello, world!";

    // Booleans: represent true or false values
    let isTrue = true;
    let isFalse = false;

    // Undefined: represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value
    let undefinedVar;

    // Null: represents the intentional absence of any value
    let nullValue = null;

    // Objects: collections of key-value pairs
    let person = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 30,
    isStudent: true
    };

    // Arrays: ordered lists of values
    let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];

    // Functions: blocks of reusable code
    function greet(name) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
    
}

<!-- QUES2-What are the uses of JavaScript Operators? -->
ANS-
1-Arithmetic Operators: Perform mathematical calculations like addition (+), subtraction (-),
multiplication (*), division (/), and more. Useful for performing math in your code.

2-Assignment Operators: Assign values to variables. For example, = assigns a value to a variable
(x = 5).

3-Comparison Operators: Compare values and return true or false. For instance, == checks if two
values are equal, > checks if one value is greater than another, and so on.

4-Logical Operators: Combine multiple conditions and return a result based on their truthiness.
 For example, && (AND) and || (OR) are used to create compound conditions.

5-Unary Operators: Work on a single operand. For instance, ++ increments a value by 1, and
 -- decrements a value by 1.

6-Ternary Operator: A conditional operator that evaluates a condition and returns one value if 
the condition is true and another value if the condition is false. It looks like condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse.

7-String Operators: Concatenate strings together using the + operator. For example, "Hello, " + "world!" 
will result in "Hello, world!".

<!-- QUES3-Explain the Assignment Operator.? -->
ANS-The assignment operator in JavaScript (=) is like a simple "equals" sign. It's used to assign a value to a variable.

let x = 5;

Here, the = assigns the value 5 to the variable x. Whatever value is on the right side gets assigned to the variable on the left side.

It's like giving a box (the variable) a specific thing (the value) and saying, "Here, hold this for me." This way, you can store
and use different values in variables throughout your code.

<!-- QUES4-Explain the all Arithmetic Operators.? -->
ANS-the basic arithmetic operators in JavaScript:
1-Addition (+): Adds two numbers together.
let sum = 3 + 5; // sum will be 8

2-Subtraction (-): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.
let difference = 10 - 4; // difference will be 6

3-Multiplication (*): Multiplies two numbers.
let product = 2 * 6; // product will be 12

4-Division (/): Divides the left operand by the right operand.
let quotient = 20 / 4; // quotient will be 5

5-Modulus (%): Gives the remainder of a division operation.
let remainder = 10 % 3; // remainder will be 1

6-Exponentiation ()**: Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand
let result = 2 ** 3; // result will be 8 (2 raised to the power of 3)

These operators are used in mathematical calculations to perform addition, subtraction,
 multiplication, division, finding remainders, and raising numbers to a certain power.

 <!-- QUES5-What are the Binary Operators in js. -->
 ANS-Binary operators in JavaScript are those operators that work on two operands, meaning they require 
 two values to perform an operation. They take two values (operands) and perform a specific action on
  them. Here are some examples:

 Arithmetic Operators:
 
 Addition (+)
 Subtraction (-)
 Multiplication (*)
 Division (/)
 Modulus (%)
 Exponentiation (**)
 Comparison Operators:
 
 Equal to (==)
 Not equal to (!=)
 Greater than (>)
 Less than (<)
 Greater than or equal to (>=)
 Less than or equal to (<=)
 Logical Operators:
 
 AND (&&)
 OR (||)
 Assignment Operators:
 
 Assignment (=)
 Compound assignment operators like +=, -=, *=, /=, etc.
 Binary operators perform their specific operation on the two values they are applied to, and the
 result is usually a single value. For example, the addition operator + takes two numbers and adds
 them together, while the logical AND (&&) operator returns true only if both operands are true.

 <!-- QUES6-Explain the Pre-Increment and Post Increment in js. -->
 ANS-
 1-Pre-increment (++): Increases the value of a variable before using its current value in an expression.
 let x = 5;
let y = ++x; // y will be 6, x will be 6
Here, ++x first increments x by 1, making it 6, and then assigns the incremented value to y.

2-Post-increment (++): Increases the value of a variable after using its current value in an expression.
let a = 5;
let b = a++; // b will be 5, a will be 6
Here, a++ uses the current value of a in the expression (which is 5), then increments a by 1, making it 6,
 and assigns the original value to b.

In simple terms, pre-increment increases the value first and then uses it, while post-increment uses
the current value and then increments it.
