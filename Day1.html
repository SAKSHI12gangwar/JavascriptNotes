    <!-- Ques1-JavaScript Questions  What are the different data types present in javascript? -->

ANS-Number: Represents both integers and floating-point numbers, like 5 or 3.14.

String: Represents text, enclosed in either single ('') or double ("") quotes, like "hello".

Boolean: Represents a logical entity and can have two values: true or false.

Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned any value.

Null: Represents the intentional absence of any value.

Object: A complex data type that can store collections of data, including key-value pairs.

Symbol: A unique and immutable data type often used as an identifier for object properties.

BigInt: A relatively new addition that allows representation of whole numbers larger than Number can handle.

<!-- QUES2-What are the JavaScript Engines? -->

JavaScript engines are programs that execute JavaScript code in web browsers or server environments. They parse and interpret the code, optimizing it for faster
execution. Engines like V8 (used in Chrome), SpiderMonkey (used in Firefox), and Chakra (used in older versions of Microsoft Edge) translate JavaScript into machine
code that computers can understand and run. They handle tasks like memory management, garbage collection, and performance enhancements to ensure efficient code execution.

<!-- QUES3-Explain ECMA in JS.? -->
ANS-ECMA in JavaScript stands for the European Computer Manufacturers Association, which defines the standards for scripting languages like JavaScript. The ECMAScript
standardizes the rules and structures that JavaScript should follow, ensuring consistency across different browsers and platforms. It outlines the features, syntax,
and behavior of JavaScript, allowing developers to write code that works reliably across various environments. Essentially, ECMAScript provides the blueprint for how
JavaScript should work and evolve

<!-- QUES4-Why We use JavaScript? -->
ANS-Web Development: It's primarily used for enhancing interactivity and functionality on websites. It can manipulate HTML and CSS, making web pages dynamic and responsive without needing to reload the entire page.

Building Web Applications: JavaScript frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Vue.js facilitate building complex web applications with rich user interfaces.

Server-Side Development: With Node.js, JavaScript can be used to build server-side applications, enabling developers to use a single language (JavaScript) for both front-end and back-end development.

Game Development: JavaScript, coupled with libraries like Phaser or Three.js, is used to create games playable in web browsers.

Mobile App Development: Frameworks such as React Native or Ionic enable the development of mobile applications using JavaScript.

IoT (Internet of Things) Development: JavaScript is employed in IoT development for programming devices and connecting them to the web.

<!-- QUES5-What is JavaScript? And also Explain the histroy of JavaScript? -->
ANS-JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 while he was working at Netscape Communications Corporation. Originally named Mocha, it was later renamed to LiveScript and finally JavaScript for marketing purposes.

1995: JavaScript was introduced in Netscape Navigator 2.0 as a way to add interactivity to web pages.

1996: Microsoft released JScript, their version of JavaScript for Internet Explorer.

1997: ECMAScript, a standardized specification for JavaScript, was established by ECMA International to ensure compatibility across different browsers.

Early 2000s: JavaScript became more popular with the rise of AJAX, allowing for asynchronous data retrieval without reloading the entire web page.

2010s: JavaScript saw significant growth with the development of powerful libraries and frameworks like jQuery, Angular, React, and Node.js, expanding its use beyond just client-side scripting to server-side development and application building.
    
<!-- QUES6-What is DOM in js?  -->
ANS-
The DOM, or Document Object Model, in JavaScript is a programming interface that represents the structure of HTML and XML documents. It provides a way for programs to interact with the structure, content, and style of these documents.

In simpler terms, when a web page is loaded in a browser, the browser creates a model of that page. This model, the DOM, is a tree-like structure where each element in the HTML document (like paragraphs, headers, images) is represented as an object. JavaScript can then manipulate these objects, changing their content, style, or structure dynamically.

For example, with the DOM, you can use JavaScript to:

Change the text within a paragraph.
Add or remove elements from the page.
Modify CSS styles of elements.
Respond to user actions, like clicks or inputs.
The DOM essentially acts as a bridge between web content and scripts, allowing dynamic changes to web pages based on user interaction or other events.
