    <!-- QUES1-What are the differences between var, let and const?? -->
    ANS-
    var: Used to declare variables traditionally in JavaScript. It has a function scope, meaning it's limited to the function
    where it's declared or, if not in a function, it's globally scoped. It can be redeclared and reassigned.

    let: Introduced in newer versions of JavaScript (ES6). It has a block scope, which means it's
    limited to the block (a section of code between curly braces {}) where it's defined. Unlike var, 
    let allows reassignment but not redeclaration within the same scope.

    const: Also introduced in ES6. It's used to declare variables with a constant value that cannot
    be reassigned. However, it doesn't mean the value is immutable (unchangeable) if it's an object
    or an array; it means you can't reassign the variable itself to refer to a different object or 
    array.

    <!-- QUES2-Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN? -->
    ANS-
    Undefined is a value given to a variable that hasn't been assigned yet.
    Not defined is an error that occurs when you try to use a variable that hasn't been declared
    or is out of scope.
    NaN is a specific value representing an invalid number resulting from operations that don't yield
    a valid numeric value.

    <!-- QUES3-What is difference between null and undefined and where to use what? -->
    ANS-
    Undefined: This means a variable has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value. It's the default value of variables that have been declared but not initialized. In simple terms, it's JavaScript's way of saying "this doesn't have a value yet."
    
    Null: It's an assignment value. It's explicitly assigned by the programmer to indicate that a variable intentionally doesn't have a value or doesn't point to any object or value.
    
    When to use each:
    
    Use undefined when a variable has been declared but not yet assigned a value (by default).
    Use null to explicitly signify that a variable doesn't contain any valid value or doesn't point
    to any object.

    <!-- QUES4-What is execution context? -->
    ANS-
    Each time a function is called in JavaScript, a new execution context is created. This context
    holds details about the function being executed, its parameters, variables defined within it, 
    and where it sits in the overall structure of your code.

    There are three types of execution contexts:

    Global Execution Context: This is the default or outermost execution context. It represents
    the environment in which the code is initially executed.
    Function Execution Context: Created whenever a function is invoked or called.
    Eval Execution Context: Created when code is executed inside the eval() function.

    <!-- QUES5-What is use of prompt in JavaScript?  -->
    ANS-
    Certainly! prompt in JavaScript is a simple way to get input from users via a small dialog box
    that pops up in the browser. It displays a message to the user, along with an input field where
    they can type their response. Once they input something and press "OK," the value they entered
    is returned by the prompt function. It's handy for getting quick user input, like asking for their
    name or age, and using that input in your JavaScript code.

    <!-- QUES6-Why JavaScript is Dyanmic Language? -->
    ANS-
    Dynamic Typing: JavaScript doesn't require you to declare the data type of a variable explicitly.
    You can use the same variable to hold different types of data, and its type can change during the execution of the program.

    Dynamic Binding: Functions and objects can be altered or extended during runtime. You can add or
    modify properties and methods of objects even after they've been created.

    Eval and Function Constructors: JavaScript provides eval(), which can execute code dynamically,
    and Function constructors that allow the creation of functions dynamically from strings.

    Prototype-based Inheritance: Objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects
    dynamically, allowing for flexible and dynamic object-oriented programming.
